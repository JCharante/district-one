# District One Stats privacy policy

*Last updated: February 26, 2020*

*In the interest of full disclosure, this privacy policy is adapted from [Basecamp's Privacy Policy](https://github.com/basecamp/policies/blob/master/privacy/privacy-policy.md)*

The privacy of your data — and it is your data, not ours! — is a big deal to us. We log all access to all accounts by IP address, so we can always protect against abuse.

## Identity & access

When you sign up for District One Stats, we ask for your phone number. That's just so you can personalize your new account, and we can store your information between sessions. We’ll never sell your personal info to third parties.

When you write District One Stats with a question or to ask for help, we'll keep that correspondence, and the email address, for future reference. When you use our web application, we'll track that for statistical purposes (like conversion rates and to test new designs). We also store any information you volunteer, like surveys, for as long as it makes sense.

The only times we’ll ever share your info:

* To provide products or services you've requested, with your permission. (See our policy on processors below)
* To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or as otherwise required by law.

## Your Rights With Respect to Your Information

You may have heard about the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in Europe. GDPR gives people under its protection certain rights with respect to their personal information collected by us on the Site. Accordingly, District One Stats recognizes and will comply with GDPR and those rights, except as limited by applicable law. The rights under GDPR include:

* **Right of Access.** This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.
* **Right to Correction.** This is your right to request correction of your personal information.
* **Right to Erasure.** This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession (also known as the “Right to be forgotten”).  However, if applicable law requires us to comply with your request to delete your information, fulfillment of your request may prevent you from using District One Stats and may result in closing your account.
* **Right to Complain.** You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority.
* **Right to Restrict Processing.** This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed.
* **Right to Object.** This is your right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.
* **Right to Portability.** This is your right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.
* **Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making.** This is your right to object and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or similarly significant, effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable European law, or is based on your explicit consent.

Many of these rights can be exercised by contact us at [dos@jcharante.com](mailto:dos@jcharante.com).


## Processors we use

We utilize Twilio to handle all text-messaging on our platform. This means that when you sign up for an account and receive a verification code, we have passed onto Twilio the provided phone number.

## Law enforcement

The nature of this site makes it very unlikely that law enforcement will ever ask for your data, particularly because we only identify you by your phone number, but in the rare case of it:

District One Stats won’t hand your data over to law enforcement unless a court order says we have to. We flat-out reject requests from local and federal law enforcement when they seek data without a court order. And unless we're legally prevented from it, we’ll always inform you when such requests are made.

## Security & Encryption

All data is encrypted via [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) when transmitted from our servers to your browser. There are no database backups, but if there were then they would be left on the default settings of MongoDB Atlas. Data isn’t encrypted while it's live in our database (since it needs to be ready to send to you when you need it).

## Deleted data

When you cancel your account, we'll ensure that nothing is stored on our servers past 30 days. When you unfavorite a team or event, such records are removed from our servers within a few seconds. Deleting an account requires a manual process, and as such this 30-day policy allows for time to invoke the manual process.

## Location of Site and Data

This Site is operated in the United States. If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States. By using our Site, participating in any of our services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.


## Changes & questions

District one Stats may update this policy once in a blue moon — we’ll notify you about significant changes by placing a prominent notice on our site. You can access, change or delete your personal information at any time by contacting support at dos@jcharante.com.
